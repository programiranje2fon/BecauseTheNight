Baby was a black sheep, baby was a whore
Baby got big and baby get bigger
Baby get something, baby get more
Baby, baby, baby was a rock and roll nigga
Oh, look around you, all around you
Riding on a copper wave
Do you like the world around you?
Are you ready to behave?

Outside of society, they're waitin' for me
Outside of society, that's where I want to be
Baby was a black sheep, baby was a whore
You know she got big, well, she's gonna get bigger
Baby got a hand, got a finger on the trigger
Baby, baby, baby is a rock and roll nigga

Outside of society, that's where I want to be
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me

(Those who have suffered, understand suffering
And thereby extend their hand
The storm that brings harm
Also makes fertile
Blessed is the grass
And herb and the true thorn and light)

I was lost in a valley of pleasure
I was lost in the infinite sea
I was lost, and measure for measure
Love spewed from the heart of me
I was lost, and the cost
And the cost didn't matter to me
I was lost, and the cost
Was to be outside society

Jimi Hendrix was a nigga
Jesus Christ and grandma, too
Jackson Pollock was a nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga

Outside of society, they're waitin' for me
Outside of society, if you're looking
That's where you'll find me
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me
Outside of society
